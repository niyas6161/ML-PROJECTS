machinelearning project, which implements multiple linear regression model using car price prediction dataset. which has a good amount of preprocessing work (encoding using get dummies, data type conversion, filling missing values, etc..)

steps involved
1. Dataset loading 
2. Dataset cleaning
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Model creation
5. Visualization
